Job Description:

**[Paper Implementation]**

1. [CVPR-2016] Ordinal Regression with Multiple Output CNN for Age Estimation

What do I learn from this work: The better loss the better performance. It's a must to find the nature of the problem and choose a loss to train the neural network.

2. Wide Residual Networks

What do I learn from this work: The backward gradient sometimes may not update all the parameters of **depth** neural network. A wider one can make a good use of every gradient.

3. [CVPR-2017] Predicting Ground-Level Scene Layout from Aerial Imagery

What do I learn from this work: Use Spatial Transformer like network to learn the transform from aerial to ground to better extract the feature.

**[Paper Reading]**
