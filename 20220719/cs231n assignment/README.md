# CS231n Assignment

## Assignment 1: k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier

In this assignment, I implement a classifier based on k nearest neighbor algorithm for CIFAR-10 dataset. To run the
model, please enter:

```angular2html
python assignment_1.py # It takes LONG time to run the code!
```

## Assignment 2: 2-layer Neural Network Classifier

In this assignment, I implement a classifier based on 2 layers neural network for CIFAR-10 dataset. To run the model,
please enter:

```angular2html
python assignment_2.py # It's OK to run the code.
```

## Assignment 3: RNN Regression

In this assignment, I build an RNN model for regression task. To run the model, please enter:

```angular2html
python assignment_3.py
```
